      <p>
        Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience delivering small to medium projects in a wide range of business
        cases. I have
        independently taken on projects from start to finish, as well as within tight knit teams. I have a varied skill
        set, specialising
        in back-end and infrastructure, but with experience in front-end too. Allowing me to deliver projects on-time,
        on-budget,
        with the highest quality of workmanship. I always strive to ensure systems are built with speed, simplicity, and
        reliability
        in mind, and always look for the next best thing that will make that goal easier to achieve. Adhering to modern
        standards in
        all technologies I use, I have ensured that I can always create the best software possible at all times,
        striving for the utmost
        simplicity and efficiency. I am always keen to learn and adapt to both new and existing technologies
