          Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience delivering small,
          medium, and large projects in a wide range of business cases. I have

          within tight knit teams. I have a varied skill set within programming,
          DevOps, and project management. Allowing me to deliver projects
          on-time, on-budget, with the highest quality of workmanship. I always
          strive to ensure systems are built with speed, simplicity, and
          reliability in mind, and always look for the next best thing that will
          make that goal easier to achieve. Adhering to modern standards in all
          technologies I use, I have ensured that I can always create the best
          software possible at all times, striving for the utmost simplicity and
          efficiency. I am always keen to learn and adapt to new technologies.
